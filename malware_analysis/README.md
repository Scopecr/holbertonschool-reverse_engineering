# Malware Analysis README

## Overview
This repository contains tools and documentation for analyzing Android applications suspected of malicious behavior. The focus is on understanding the functionality of the provided APK files and detecting suspicious or harmful activities.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Analyze `malware_0.apk`
#### Objective
Analyze the Android application `malware_0.apk` to understand its functionality and detect any suspicious behavior, specifically focusing on how it handles user input and whether it logs keystrokes.

#### Instructions
1. **Extract and Analyze the APK**
  - Unpack the APK file to access its source code and resources.
  - Use tools like `apktool`, `jadx`, or `MobSF` for decompilation.

2. **Identify Suspicious Behavior**
  - Check for potentially harmful activities, such as data collection, permissions abuse, or hidden functionalities.
  - Look for code related to keylogging or unauthorized data capture.

3. **Determine the Input Handling Technique**
  - Identify how the app processes user input (e.g., via event listeners, accessibility services, native libraries, etc.).
  - Specifically, check if it captures and logs keystrokes.

4. **Document Findings**
  - Write down the identified input-handling technique in the file `0-solution.txt`.

#### Target App
- **APK File:** `malware_0.apk`
- **Output File:** `0-solution.txt`

### Task 2: Analyze `malware_1.apk`
#### Objective
Analyze the Android application `malware_1.apk` to understand its functionality and detect any malicious behavior, specifically identifying the Command & Control (C2) domain used for data exfiltration.

#### Instructions
1. **Extract and Analyze the APK**
  - Unpack the APK file to access its source code and resources.
  - Use tools like `apktool`, `jadx`, or `MobSF` for decompilation.

2. **Identify Malicious Behavior**
  - Look for indicators of compromise, such as data theft, remote access, or unauthorized network connections.
  - Analyze permissions, API calls, and network-related functions.

3. **Extract the C2 Domain**
  - Locate the domain or IP address used for Command & Control communication.
  - Check network requests, hardcoded strings, or encrypted data transmissions.

4. **Document Findings**
  - Write the identified C2 domain into the file `1-solution.txt`.

#### Target App
- **APK File:** `malware_1.apk`
- **Output File:** `1-solution.txt`
