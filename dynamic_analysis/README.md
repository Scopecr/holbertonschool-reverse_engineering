# Dynamic Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on dynamic analysis, a critical technique in reverse engineering that involves observing a program's behavior during execution. By leveraging various tools and methodologies, you will gain insights into how programs interact with the operating system, access resources, and communicate over networks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the key differences between static and dynamic analysis, and explain the importance of dynamic analysis in reverse engineering.
- Employ techniques such as setting breakpoints, performing memory dumps, and tracing program execution during dynamic analysis.
- Utilize debugging tools like GDB, x64dbg, and OllyDbg to analyze binary files and track their execution.
- Monitor system behavior during program execution using tools like Process Monitor and Wireshark.
- Analyze a program's interaction with the operating system, including file system access, API calls, and network communications.
- Document findings from dynamic analysis, including observed behaviors and potential vulnerabilities, following best practices.
- Apply dynamic analysis skills in real-world scenarios such as malware analysis, security testing, and software debugging.

## Requirements

### General Guidelines

- **Allowed Tools:** GDB, x64dbg, OllyDbg, Cuckoo Sandbox, Wireshark, ProcMon, Intel Pin, Valgrind, Sysinternals Suite.
- Conduct all analyses in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine or sandbox.
- Regularly back up all files and data during the analysis process.
- Ensure all scripts and tools are executable and runnable on Kali Linux.
- Use relative paths for all file references; avoid hardcoded values for paths.
- Validate the integrity of binaries and scripts before analyzing them to prevent potential issues.
- Configure monitoring tools correctly before starting the analysis.
- Organize and format all findings and documentation for easy reference and reporting.
- Focus your analysis on the target binary provided for the project.
- Perform all work locally within your controlled environment; online tools or services are not allowed.

## Tools and Techniques

This project will involve the use of various tools and techniques, including:

- **Debugging Tools:** GDB, x64dbg, OllyDbg for binary analysis and execution tracking.
